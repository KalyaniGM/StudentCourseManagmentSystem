# StudentCourseManagmentSystem:
The management system will perform CRUD operations on student &amp; course. Also validations are applied while creating Student &amp; Course. The Application is created using MVC, MVC Architecture mainly creates Model, View & Controller & based on TDD (Test Driven Development). Use of MVC here is because it provides Separation of concerns, The Separation of concerns philosophy states that each component of the application is responsible for only one thing. They should do not depend upon any other component as much as possible. In other words, the components should be loosely coupled with other. The application built using such a concept is easily testable, maintainable and extensible. The MVC Pattern follows the separation of concerns philosophy. Each of the three layers in MVC can be developed and tested independent of each other and combined together to create a robust application. The important point to note here is that the MVC Pattern is Presentation layer pattern. It only deals with the how & when the data is presented to the User. You need to use this pattern along the data access layer and business layer etc. to create a complete application.
